### Third-Party-APIs
In this app i worked withThird-Party APIs by implementing functions and create a time management app.


#Create a function to generate a unique task id
 The concept behind generating a unique task ID using a timestamp and a random number is to create a distinct identifier for each task that is both unique and difficult to predict. This unique task ID can be useful in various applications 
 where tasks need to be tracked, stored, or referenced uniquely.

#Create a function to create a task card

The concept of creating a task card in a full-stack application involves designing a visual representation of a task that includes key information such as the task title, description, deadline, status, and any other relevant details. Task cards are commonly used in project management applications to display and manage individual tasks within a project.Task Details: A task card typically includes essential details about a task, such as the title (or name) of the task, a brief description explaining the task, the deadline by which the task needs to be completed, and possibly additional information like task status, priority, or assigned team member.


#Create HTML structure using template literals

Using template literals in JavaScript allows you to create dynamic strings with embedded expressions. When creating HTML structures using template literals, you can easily generate complex HTML elements with dynamic content based on variables or data. Template Literal Syntax: Template literals are enclosed in backticks (`). Within a template literal, you can include placeholders ${} to insert expressions or variables.

Dynamic Content: By using template literals, you can dynamically generate HTML content by interpolating variables, expressions, or function calls within the ${} placeholders.
Multi-line Strings: Template literals support multi-line strings, making it easier to create structured HTML elements with proper indentation for readability.


#HTML Element Generation: You can use template literals to construct HTML elements, including tags, attributes, and content, in a concise and readable manner.
 Dynamic Data Binding: Template literals allow you to bind dynamic data to HTML content, enabling the creation of reusable templates that can be populated with different data sets.
